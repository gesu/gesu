  <h2>
    Mercedes Benz 380SL Power Steering Pump Rebuild
  </h2>
  <p>
    My power steering pump was leaking fluid everywhere so I bought a repair kit and rebuilt it. The repair kit contained a radial seal for the shaft, two big O-rings for the back seal, a copper washer and another small O-ring.
  </p>
  <p>
    While you're replacing the seals, you can also install a new filter for the pump since you'll be draining it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Didn't really take pictures of this (I'll try to do that for other projects). I followed this <a target="_blank" href="//www.startekinfo.com/StarTek/outside/11883/PROGRAM/Chassis/46-720.pdf">Mercedes guide</a> loosely. Googling around for stuff also helped a lot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time to complete: <strong>5 hours</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Part 1: Getting the Pump Off
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Drain the pump.</strong> You don't have to do this if you don't care about leaking power steering fluid everywhere. But you'd be a monster if you don't. Seriously just do it. I used a syringe to manually clear it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're planning on replacing the filter, you can do it here.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove the fan.</strong> This is pretty easy; just remove the four bolts holding the fan and then ease it out. You may have to stick a wrench in between the bolts to stop the fan from rotating while you try to loosen the bolts.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove the power steering belts.</strong> First you have to loosen the belt tensioner to give them some slack. It's sitting behind the reservoir and has a hex screw top. You won't be able to get the belts off entirely because the other belts are in the way (this car has too many belts), but it will free the pump.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>(Optional) Loosen the volume control bolt on the pump.</strong> There is a big (22mm ish) bolt with a copper washer on the front of the pump that is really hard to loosen when the pump is not attached to the car. If you're going to be replacing this copper washer, I highly recommend you loosen this bolt before you begin removing the pump. Don't remove it all way while it's still in the car because there's a spring inside that can shoot out if you're not careful.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove the pump from the car.</strong> There are three bolts and two hoses that need to be removed. These can get pretty tricky because there isn't much space to remove either of them. The bolts are 13mm and the hoses are 17mm and 19mm.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    Part 2: Replacing the Seals
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove the pulley.</strong> Easiest way to do this is to set the pulley on two blocks of wood and hit the shaft with a hammer until the pulley comes off.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would actually recommend that you do not use a pulley remover here even if you have one. The pulley wheels are pretty flexible and if your pulley is stuck hard on the shaft it's easy to bend them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Replacing the radial seal.</strong> You'll need to remove the Woodruff Key from the shaft first. It's half moon shaped and should come out easily with a flathead screwdriver.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seal is at the base of the shaft. It's pretty thick compared to the rest of the seals in the repair kit. Mine was really old, so it was pretty hard to get it out. I used a small, thin screwdriver and hammered it in between the outer casing and the rubber and was able to pop it out that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a special tool for doing this job that Mercedes recommends but if you have that tool you probably don't need this guide. Either way, the old seal gets completely destroyed in the processes so don't be afraid to go at it. Once the old seal is out, you can place the new one in.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Replacing the back seal.</strong> The back of the pump looks like an indented circle. You will need to use a clamp to apply pressure to this back plate in order to remove the wire clamp that holds the back plate in place. The wire clamp is a circular metal ring that has a gap of about 1cm in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the wire clamp is removed, you will be able to remove the circular back plate. If this plate does not come out easily, that means you've angled it the wrong way and you'll need to coax it a bit. There's a spring behind this plate that puts pressure on the plate outwards, so keep that in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the back plate is out, you will be able to remove the old O-ring and install the new one. Make sure to remember which way the spring is facing when putting it back together.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Replacing the volume control seal.</strong> This seal is the copper washer that is underneath the large bolt on the front of the pump. If you've done the optional step, you just need to fully remove the bolt and simply replace the washer.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    Part 3: Putting it Back Together
  </h3>
  <p>
    Once you've replaced the seals, you basically just need to put the pulley wheel back on and do part 1 again but in reverse.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Additional Notes
  </h3>
  <p>
    I only replaced the seals for the pump and didn't get into the actual innards. Since I was just dealing with a leak, there wasn't any reason for me to do so. If you need to go in there and have to replace the radial seal also, I think you can get into it from the side and just push the entire shaft outwards.
  </p>
